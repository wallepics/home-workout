<p><strong>16 Week Workout Results</strong>, Perform each training day once per week with distributed rest days such as Monday Tuesday Thursday and Friday. I will do three of those workouts per week with high repetitions in a circuit. On one or two of your non-training days perform at least 30 minutes of moderate activity such as a recreational sport low-impact cardio or another mode of enjoyable exercise. The new portion of the workout is split into two parts.</p>
